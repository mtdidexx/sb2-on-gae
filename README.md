Spring Boot 2 App that runs on Google App Engine Standard

# Purpose
This is meant to be a very simple Spring Boot 2 application that can be deployed to Google App Engine Standard. It's a way for me to test things out without generating a bunch of broken builds.

Things that this app does:
1. Exposes an API endpoint that requires basic auth
2. Contains a GAE cron job
